The app is designed to be a dynamic snooker game where players can interact with the game through various mechanics like cue aiming, power control, and ball physics.
The game leverages the Matter.js physics engine for real-time collision detection and ball movement, allowing for a more immersive and realistic snooker experience.
The table, balls, and pockets are all rendered with specific dimensions, and there is a well-defined user interface (UI) for managing the game.

Key Features:

Ball Setup and Management: 
The game creates a variety of balls, including red and colored balls. The cue ball is also present, and players interact with it using a cue stick.
Balls are randomly placed on the table when required.

Power-ups: 
The extension of the game includes power-ups like "Exploding Balls," "Speedy," and "Slowpoke" where their effect lasts for 5 seconds.
These power-ups are assigned randomly to red balls. When a player collides with one of these balls, it activates the power-up:

Slowpoke Rodriguez reduces the speed of all balls.
Speedy Gonzalez doubles the speed of balls.
Explosion increases the velocity of balls.

Respawn Feature: 
The power-up balls have a respawn feature, where they regenerate every 10 seconds. If a power-up ball is removed from the game (due to collision or other interactions), 
it will respawn as a random last few red balls remaining on the table.

Cue Mechanism: 
The cue stick allows the player to aim at the cue ball and control its velocity by adjusting the power. 
Players can increase or decrease the power by pressing specific keys ("A" or "D"), and the cue distance adjusts accordingly. There’s also an option to toggle the
dragging of the cue ball for repositioning.

Game Interaction: 
Users interact with the game by dragging and dropping the cue ball, adjusting power, and activating power-ups. 
The game's visual and interactive elements are designed to provide clear feedback on the state of power-ups, the position of the cue ball, and other dynamic elements.

Unique Extension (Power-up Feature): 
The addition of the power-up system introduces a unique layer of strategy and excitement to the game. 
Players not only focus on precision but also on exploiting power-ups for an advantage. These power-ups significantly impact the flow of the game, 
adding an element of unpredictability. Additionally, the respawn feature ensures that power-ups remain a dynamic part of the gameplay, requiring the player
to continuously adapt their strategy. This makes the game more engaging, as players can plan around the power-up balls’ effects and their respawn cycles.

In summary, this app not only functions as a traditional snooker game but also incorporates innovative elements such as power-ups and 
respawn mechanics that enhance gameplay and create unique, unpredictable challenges for players.
